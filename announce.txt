[ANN] zcube 0.0.2

Hi, clojure community. It is my pleasure to announce zcube[1], a Clojure library all about counting trees for analytical purposes.

The intent is to compute aggregate sums over multiple hierarchical dimensions, based on the (old) algorithmic ideas exposed in [2] by Pr. Minato et Al, and implemented in an immutable setting suitable for concurrent and functional programming.

The 0.0.2 version provides a parallel bulk API to compute aggregates over lazy sequences, taking advantage of multicores.
